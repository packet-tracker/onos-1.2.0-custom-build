/**
 * Represents a description of which types of traffic need to
 * be forwarded through the device. A forwarding objective may
 * result in multiple rules at the device. There are two main types
 * of forwarding objectives:
 *
 *  - Versatile
 *  - Specific
 *
 * A versatile forwarding objective represents a composite rule that matches
 * two or more header fields. The use of versatile usually indicates that this
 * rule should be inserted in its entirety into the ACL table. Although,
 * drivers for some devices are free to implement this differently.
 *
 * A specific forwarding objective represents a specific rule matching one or
 * more header fields. The installation of this rule may result in several rules
 * at the device. For example, one per table type.
